## Ingredients
### Filling
- 500 g cooked, finely shredded chicken (poached or rotisserie)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 onion, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste (or 1 grated tomato)
- 60 ml chicken stock
- 2 tbsp chopped parsley
- 80–120 g cream cheese or **Catupiry**-style requeijão
- Salt & pepper

### Dough
- 500 ml chicken stock
- 250 ml milk
- 40 g butter
- 1 tsp salt
- 300 g all-purpose flour

### Breading & Frying
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1–1.5 cups breadcrumbs (fine)
- Neutral oil for deep frying (170–175°C / 340–350°F)

## Instructions
1. **Filling:** Sauté onion in oil; add garlic. Stir in tomato paste and stock; simmer 1–2 min. Fold in chicken and parsley; season. Cool, then dot in the cream cheese so there are creamy pockets.
2. **Dough:** In a saucepan, bring stock, milk, butter, and salt to a boil. Dump in flour at once; stir vigorously until it pulls from the pan and looks smooth (2–3 min). Cool until warm.
3. **Shape:** Oil hands. Pinch off ~40 g dough; flatten into a disk. Add 1 tbsp filling; close into a teardrop, pinching tip to seal.
4. **Bread:** Dip in egg, then breadcrumbs. Rest 10 min.
5. **Fry:** 170–175°C until deep golden (about 3–4 min). Drain on rack. Serve hot with chili sauce.

**Bake option:** Brush with oil; bake 200°C / 400°F for 18–22 min, turning once.
