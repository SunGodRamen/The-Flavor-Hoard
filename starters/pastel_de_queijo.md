## Ingredients
### Dough
- 300 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 tsp vinegar **or** 1 tbsp cachaça (extra blister/crisp)
- 160–180 ml warm water (as needed)

### Filling
- 250–300 g melty cheese, shredded (mozzarella + provolone or prato)
- Pinch oregano or black pepper (optional)

### Frying
- Neutral oil for deep-frying (175–180°C / 350–360°F)

## Instructions
1. **Dough:** Mix flour and salt. Add oil, vinegar/cachaça, and most of the water; knead 3–4 min to a smooth, firm dough. Rest, covered, 20–30 min.
2. **Roll:** Divide into 10–12 pieces. Roll very thin rectangles/ovals (1–2 mm).
3. **Fill:** Place cheese on half, leaving a 1 cm border. Season lightly if desired. Fold over; press to seal, then crimp with a fork. **Important:** No air pockets.
4. **Fry:** In hot oil, fry 1–2 at a time until blistered and golden, 60–90 sec per side. Drain on rack. Serve immediately with chili vinegar.

**Tip:** If edges open, brush border with a smear of water-flour paste before sealing.
