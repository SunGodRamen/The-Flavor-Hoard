## Equipment
- Small saucepan
- Dropper/squeeze bottle or syringe
- Tall glass/jar with well-chilled oil
- Fine-mesh strainer

## Ingredients
- 100 ml balsamic vinegar (or balsamic reduction for sweeter pearls)
- 1–1.5 g agar-agar powder (about 0.5–0.75 tsp)
- 200–300 ml neutral oil (grapeseed, canola, or sunflower), well chilled

## Equipment
- Saucepan
- Dropper, squeeze bottle, or syringe
- Tall glass or jar for the oil bath
- Fine mesh strainer

## Instructions
1. **Chill oil:** Place neutral oil in a tall glass and refrigerate at least 30 min (or freeze 10–15). The oil must be very cold for pearls to set.
2. **Mix agar:** In a small saucepan, whisk balsamic vinegar with agar-agar. Bring to a gentle boil, simmer 1–2 min until agar dissolves.
3. **Cool slightly:** Let mixture cool 2–3 min (50–55°C / 120–130°F).
4. **Form pearls:** Using a dropper, drip warm mixture into the cold oil. Drops sink and set into spheres.
5. **Collect:** Strain oil + pearls through a fine sieve. Rinse pearls briefly under cold water.
6. **Serve:** Use immediately as garnish for salads, meats, cheeses, or desserts.

## Notes
- Adjust agar if pearls are too soft (add slightly more) or too firm (use less).
- Flavor variations: add honey, herbs, or spices to balsamic before boiling.
- Store up to 3 days in fridge, submerged in a little balsamic reduction.
