## Ingredients
- 100 g finely grated parmesan cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano preferred)
- Optional: pinch of black pepper, chili flakes, or sesame seeds

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat.
2. Place heaping tablespoons of parmesan in small mounds, spacing well. Flatten lightly into thin circles.
3. Sprinkle with optional seasonings.
4. Bake 4–6 minutes until golden and lacy. Watch closely—cheese burns fast.
