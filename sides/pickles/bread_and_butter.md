## Ingredients
- 6 small cucumbers (about 1 kg), thinly sliced

- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 250 ml white vinegar
- 250 ml apple cider vinegar
- 200 g granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp mustard seeds
- 1 tsp celery seeds
- 1 tsp turmeric

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, toss cucumber and onion slices with kosher salt. Cover with ice and let sit 1–2 hours. Drain and rinse well.
2. In a saucepan, combine vinegars, sugar, mustard seeds, celery seeds, and turmeric. Bring to a boil until sugar dissolves.
3. Add cucumbers and onions to hot brine. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Pack hot pickles and brine into sterilized jars, leaving 1 cm headspace. Seal with lids.
5. Cool, then refrigerate. Flavors develop after 24 hours; keeps up to 2 months chilled.

- Adjust sugar to taste if you prefer a less sweet pickle.
