## Equipment
- Small saucepan (scald liquid)
- Large mixing bowl & sturdy spoon or stand mixer (paddle)
- Baking sheets + parchment
- Oven
- Measuring cups & spoons

## Ingredients
- 300 g tapioca starch (polvilho doce)  
  *Optional:* swap 75 g for **polvilho azedo** (225 g doce + 75 g azedo) for extra tang & lift
- 150 ml whole milk
- 60 ml water
- 70 ml neutral oil (or 50 ml neutral oil + 20 ml melted butter)
- 6–7 g fine salt (about 1 tsp), to taste
- 2 large eggs (≈100 g without shells), room temp
- 180–220 g finely grated cheese  
  **Best:** queijo Minas meia-cura. **Sub:** 120 g Parmesan + 80–100 g low-moisture mozzarella

## Instructions
1. **Heat & scald:** Heat milk, water, oil, and salt in a small saucepan just to a simmer. Put tapioca starch in a large bowl. Pour the hot liquid over it and stir with a sturdy spoon until evenly damp and shaggy. Cool **5–8 min** (warm, not hot).
2. **Eggs in:** Beat in the eggs **one at a time** until glossy and sticky. A stand mixer with paddle helps. The dough should be elastic and slightly tacky.
3. **Cheese & adjust:** Mix in the grated cheese. If dough seems **too wet**, sprinkle in 1–2 tbsp (8–16 g) more tapioca; if **too dry/crumbly**, add 1–2 tbsp milk.
4. **Shape:** Lightly oil your hands. Roll into walnut-sized balls (18–22 g each). Space on lined trays.
5. **Bake:** 200°C / 400°F for **18–22 min** until puffed with light golden spots. Avoid over-browning to keep interiors chewy.
6. **Serve:** Eat hot. Classic with **goiabada** or butter.

## Notes
- **Texture control:** More *polvilho doce* = chewier; some *polvilho azedo* = airier & slightly tangy.
- **Freezer-friendly:** Freeze formed balls on a tray, then bag. Bake from frozen at 200°C / 400°F for **20–24 min**.
- **Cheese swaps:** Pecorino, aged Asiago, or sharp cheddar (mixed with a melter like mozzarella) also work.
- **Quick blender version (mini-muffin):** Blend 1 egg, 80 ml milk, 60 ml oil, 120 g tapioca starch, 60–80 g grated cheese, 1/2 tsp salt for 30 sec. Fill greased mini-muffin tin 3/4 full; bake 200°C / 400°F for **15–18 min**.
