## Equipment
- Large pot + colander
- Potato ricer/food mill or masher
- Saucepan (warm milk/cream)
- Wooden spoon or spatula
- Whisk (optional)

## Ingredients
- 1.5 kg Yukon Gold potatoes (fluffy: use Russets)
- 150–200 g unsalted butter, cubed
- 180–240 ml (3/4–1 cup) warm milk or cream (to taste)
- 10–12 g fine salt (for the cooking water), plus more to taste
- Freshly ground white or black pepper
- Optional: 1–2 tsp sour cream or crème fraîche for tang

## Instructions
1. **Cook potatoes:** Peel (or leave skins for rustic). Cut into chunks. Start in **cold** well-salted water; simmer until very tender, 18–25 min.
2. **Dry:** Drain well; return to hot pot over low heat 1–2 min to steam off moisture.
3. **Mash:** Rice or mill the potatoes. Fold in butter until glossy. Stream in warm milk/cream to your preferred texture.
4. **Season:** Salt/pepper to taste. For extra sheen, beat in a knob more butter.

## Notes
- **Pommes purée (very rich):** use **250–300 g butter** per 1.5 kg potatoes and ~120 ml cream. Pass through a fine sieve for ultra-smooth.
- **Make-ahead:** Hold over a bain-marie up to 1 h; loosen with hot milk before serving.
