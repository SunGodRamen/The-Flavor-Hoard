## Ingredients
- 500 g (1 lb) beef bones with marrow (cut lengthwise if possible)
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (canola or grapeseed)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 120 ml (1/2 cup) red wine
- 750 ml (3 cups) beef stock
- 1 tbsp butter (optional, for finishing)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions
1. **Roast bones:** Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). Roast bones on a tray for 20–25 minutes until browned.
2. **Cook vegetables:** In a large saucepan, heat oil. Sauté onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until caramelized.
3. **Deglaze:** Add roasted bones to the pan. Pour in red wine, scraping the bottom. Simmer 3–4 minutes to reduce.
4. **Simmer:** Add thyme, bay leaf, and beef stock. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 30–40 minutes.
5. **Strain:** Remove bones and strain sauce through a fine sieve. Discard solids.
6. **Finish:** Return to pan, simmer until reduced to a glossy jus consistency. Whisk in butter if desired.
7. **Season:** Taste and adjust with salt and pepper. Serve warm with steak.

## Notes
- Straining twice through a fine sieve gives a silky finish.  
- Can be made ahead; reheat gently, don’t boil or it may split.  
- For extra richness, scoop and whisk roasted marrow into the jus before straining.
