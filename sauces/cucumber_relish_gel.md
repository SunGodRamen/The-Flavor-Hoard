## Ingredients
- 2 large cucumbers (about 400 g / 14 oz), peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar (or white wine vinegar)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground white pepper
- 3 g (1 tsp) agar-agar powder (or 3 sheets gelatin if preferred)
- 60 ml (1/4 cup) water

## Instructions
1. **Purée cucumber:** Blend cucumber until smooth. Strain through cheesecloth or a fine sieve to yield clear cucumber juice (about 250 ml / 1 cup).
2. **Season:** Stir vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper into cucumber juice.
3. **Activate gelling agent:** In a small saucepan, whisk agar-agar into water. Bring to a boil and simmer 1–2 minutes until dissolved.
4. **Combine:** Mix hot agar solution into cucumber juice while whisking.
5. **Set:** Pour into a shallow dish. Chill in fridge 1–2 hours until firm.
6. **Relish texture:** Once set, cut gel into small cubes or mash lightly with a fork into relish-like texture.
7. **Serve:** Spoon alongside grilled meats, fish, or vegetables for a refreshing accent.

## Notes
- For a softer set, reduce agar to 2 g.  
- Gelatin can be used instead, but agar is vegetarian and holds better at room temperature.  
- Fresh herbs (mint, dill) may be folded in before setting for extra flavor.
