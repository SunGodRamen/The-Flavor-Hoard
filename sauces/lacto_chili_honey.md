## Ingredients
### Chili Mash
- 300 g fresh chilies (Fresno, jalapeño, serrano, or mix), stems removed
- 12 g kosher salt (≈4% of chili weight)
- 2–3 cloves garlic, sliced (optional)
- 100–150 g non-chlorinated water, as needed

### Honey Blend
- 350–400 g raw honey
- 2–4 tbsp fermented chili brine (from mash), to taste
- 2–4 tbsp fermented chili mash (for heat/body)
- 1–2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (optional, for brightness)

## Instructions
1. **Make chili mash:** Blend chilies, salt, garlic, and a splash of water to a coarse paste.
2. **Ferment:** Pack into a clean jar, leaving headspace. Weight the mash down. Seal loosely or use an airlock. Ferment 5–10 days at room temperature, stirring daily, until tangy and bubbly.
3. **Prepare honey blend:** Whisk raw honey with 2–4 tbsp brine and 2–4 tbsp mash until incorporated.
4. **Adjust flavor:** Add apple cider vinegar if desired for brightness.
5. **Optional strain:** For smooth texture, strain through a fine sieve. Keep solids as a spicy relish.
6. **Bottle:** Transfer to a clean jar. Let rest 24 h at room temp, then refrigerate.

## Notes
- Final pH should be ≤ 4.2 for safety.
- Keeps up to 3 months refrigerated.
- Use as a drizzle for fried chicken, pizza, cheese, roasted vegetables, or biscuits.
