A curated archive of recipes in Markdown with lightweight front-matter for tagging and cross-linking. The goal is speed: fast to read, fast to cook, and easy to extend via git.

### Seasoning: MSG Rule of Thumb

 - Monosodium glutamate is a clean umami booster. Add sparingly and taste.

 - General baseline: use ~0.2% of total dish weight (i.e., 2 g per 1 kg of food) and adjust to 0.1–0.4% to taste.

 - Soup/broth: ½–1 tsp per 1 L / 1 qt of liquid.

 - Ground meats / stir-fries: ¼–½ tsp per 450 g / 1 lb meat.

 - Dry dredges/rubs/batters: start at 0.3–0.5% of the flour/spice weight.

 - When NOT to add: heavily reduced sauces, aged cheeses, cured meats, or when using multiple high-umami ingredients (anchovy, fish sauce, kombu, Parmesan).

### Salt, Acid, Heat (Quick Guides)

 - Salt: Most proteins want 0.8–1.0% salt by weight (pre-cook); bread/pasta water should “taste like the sea.”

 - Acid: Brighten at the end with 1–2% of dish weight in citrus/vinegar for rich/stewy items.

 - Heat: Default oven roast at 220°C / 425°F for crisp veg/potatoes; pan-sear in neutral high-smoke oil, finish with butter if desired.
