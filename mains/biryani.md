## Instructions
1. **Parboil rice:** Rinse rice until water runs clear. Boil with bay leaves, star anise, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and salt until 70% cooked. Drain and set aside.
2. **Marinate chicken:** Mix yogurt, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, and ground spices (garam masala, coriander, turmeric, chili powder). Coat chicken and marinate at least 1 hour (overnight preferred).
3. **Cook chicken masala:** Heat ghee in a heavy pot. Sauté onions until deeply golden brown. Add green chili, then marinated chicken. Cook until browned and partially cooked through. Add tomatoes and simmer until thickened into a masala base.
4. **Layer biryani:** In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, spread half the rice, then all the chicken masala, then the remaining rice.
5. **Finish:** Drizzle saffron milk over the top. Cover with a tight lid (or seal with dough). Cook on very low heat (“dum”) for 20–25 minutes.
6. **Serve:** Rest 5 minutes, then fluff gently. Garnish with fried onions, cilantro, and mint. Serve hot with raita.
