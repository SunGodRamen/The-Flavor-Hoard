## Ingredients
- 80–100 g red chilies (Fresno for mild, add bird’s eye for heat), stems removed
- 3–4 cloves garlic (12–15 g), peeled
- 15–20 g fresh ginger, peeled (optional but classic)
- 45 ml fresh lime juice
- 30 ml rice vinegar
- 60–120 ml hot chicken broth (or hot water for vegan), to thin
- 10–15 g sugar, to taste
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp fish sauce (optional; skip for vegetarian)

## Instructions
1. **Blend:** In a blender, combine chilies, garlic, ginger, lime juice, vinegar, 60 ml hot broth, sugar, salt, and fish sauce if using. Purée smooth.
2. **Adjust:** Add more hot broth until pourable but body-rich. Taste for **heat/salt/acid/sweet** and balance.
3. **Rest:** Let stand **20–30 min** so flavors round out.
4. **Serve/Store:** Jar and refrigerate up to **2 weeks**. Stir before serving.

**Notes**
- For a brighter, raw profile keep the sauce uncooked; for softer garlic heat, simmer 2–3 min after blending, then chill.
- Add 1–2 tsp rendered chicken fat for gloss if serving with chicken rice.
