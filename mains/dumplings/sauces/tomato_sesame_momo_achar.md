## Equipment
- Broiler or cast-iron skillet (to char)

- Small pan (temper oil & spices)
- Heatproof bowl
- Chef’s knife & cutting board

## Ingredients
- 3 medium ripe tomatoes (≈450 g)
- 2–3 dried red chilies **or** 1–2 fresh bird’s eye chilies (to taste)
- 20 g (2 tbsp) toasted sesame seeds
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- 1–2 tbsp mustard oil (or neutral oil + 1/2 tsp mustard seeds)
- 1/4 tsp fenugreek seeds (methi), optional but classic
- 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/4–1/2 tsp ground **timur** (Sichuan pepper), optional
- 1–2 tbsp lemon juice (or to taste)
- 1–2 tbsp chopped cilantro
- 1/2–1 tsp salt, to taste
- Warm water, as needed (to thin)

## Instructions
1. **Char:** Broil or pan-char tomatoes and chilies until blistered. Cool; peel tomatoes roughly.
2. **Grind:** Pound or blend sesame seeds to a coarse paste. Add tomatoes, chilies, garlic, ginger; blend to a spoonable purée.
3. **Temper oil:** Heat mustard oil until just smoking; add fenugreek, sizzle 5–10 sec until dark brown. Kill heat; stir in turmeric.
4. **Finish:** Stir tempered oil into the purée. Season with salt, lemon juice, and timur. Fold in cilantro. Thin with warm water to a relish-like consistency. Rest 15 min; serve.

## Notes
- Mustard oil tastes harsh raw—**heat to smoking first** to mellow it. Keeps 5–7 days refrigerated.
