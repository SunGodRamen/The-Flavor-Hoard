## Ingredients
- 35–40 g finely minced ginger (≈3 tbsp, microplaned or knife-minced)
- 4 scallions, very thinly sliced (both whites & greens; ~1 cup loosely packed)
- 60–90 ml neutral oil (just enough to sizzle; canola/peanut/grapeseed)
- 3/4–1 tsp kosher salt, to taste
- Optional: pinch MSG, 1 tsp rice vinegar or rice wine

## Instructions
1. **Aromatics in bowl:** Combine ginger, scallions, and salt (plus MSG if using) in a heatproof bowl. Toss well.
2. **Heat oil:** In a small pan, heat oil over medium until shimmering and a wisp of smoke appears.
3. **Sizzle & bloom:** Carefully pour hot oil over the aromatics (it should audibly sizzle). Stir to coat and wilt.
4. **Balance:** Add a splash of rice vinegar or rice wine if desired. Adjust salt.
5. **Serve/Store:** Use warm or at room temp. Refrigerate up to **1 week**; bring to room temp and stir before serving.

**Notes**
- Texture preference: microplaned ginger = silkier; knife-minced = chunkier.  
- For a deeper nutty note, briefly warm 1–2 tsp sesame oil and fold in after blooming (don’t use it for the high-heat pour).
