## Instructions
1. **Make dough:** Mix flour and salt. Add water gradually, kneading into a soft, smooth dough. Rest covered 30 minutes.
2. **Mix filling:** Combine meat/veg with onion, garlic, ginger, chilies, cilantro, soy, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Mix well until sticky.
3. **Shape momos:** Roll dough thin and cut circles (~7–8 cm). Place 1 tsp filling in center. Fold edges pleated into a pouch or half-moon shape.
4. **Steam:** Place momos in an oiled steamer basket, not touching. Steam 8–10 minutes (meat should be fully cooked).
5. **Serve:** Hot, with **achar dipping sauce**.

## Notes
- **Fried momos:** Pan-fry steamed momos until golden on each side.  
- **Jhol momos:** Serve momos in a spicy broth-like tomato-sesame sauce.  
- Dough thickness is key: too thick = chewy, too thin = bursts.
