## Ingredients
- 300 g (about 2 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 150 ml (2/3 cup) warm water (adjust as needed)
- Optional: 1 tsp neutral oil (makes dough more elastic)

## Instructions
1. **Mix:** In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Gradually add warm water while stirring with chopsticks or a fork until shaggy dough forms.
2. **Knead:** Turn onto a floured surface. Knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add a splash more water or flour if needed.
3. **Rest:** Cover and rest at room temperature 30–60 minutes (relaxes gluten, makes rolling easier).
4. **Divide:** Roll dough into a log. Cut into 20–24 equal pieces (about 12 g each).
5. **Shape:** Roll each piece into a ball, flatten, and roll into thin rounds ~7–9 cm (3–3.5 in) diameter. Keep covered with a damp cloth to prevent drying.
6. **Use:** Fill immediately for dumplings, or stack between lightly floured parchment sheets.  

## Notes
- **For wontons:** Roll wrappers thinner (about 1 mm) and cut into squares.  
- **For pierogi/momos:** Slightly thicker (1.5–2 mm) holds heavier fillings.  
- Store unused wrappers wrapped tightly in plastic, up to 24 h in fridge, or freeze with parchment between.
