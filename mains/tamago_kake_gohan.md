- Chopsticks or whisk
- Spoon

## Ingredients
- 1 hot bowl steamed rice (200–250 g)
- 1 pasteurized egg
- 1–2 tsp soy sauce
- Optional: pinch MSG, sliced scallion, furikake, butter pat (classic "butter shoyu")

## Instructions
1. Crack egg into a bowl; beat with soy (and a pinch of MSG if using).
2. Pour over **piping hot** rice; stir until glossy and slightly thickened.
3. Top with scallion/furikake or a tiny knob of butter.

## Notes
- Use pasteurized eggs if concerned about raw egg. Hot rice gently coddles the egg.
