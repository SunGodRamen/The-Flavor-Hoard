- 1 tomato, grated or chopped fine
- 1 tsp salt, more to taste
- Handful cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges

## Instructions
1. **Soak:** Cover bread with coconut milk + 200 ml stock; mash to a thick slurry.
2. **Aromatics:** Warm neutral oil + dendê in a pot. Sauté onion until translucent; add garlic, ginger, chili; cook 1–2 min. Add tomato; cook until thick.
3. **Build body:** Stir in ground nuts and dried shrimp; cook 1 min. Add bread slurry. Stir constantly over medium-low; add more stock to reach a thick, spoonable cream.
4. **Shrimp:** Add shrimp; simmer gently 3–4 min until just cooked.
5. **Finish:** Season with salt; swirl in another spoon of dendê (to taste). Fold in cilantro.
6. **Serve:** With rice (and acarajé if making). Squeeze lime at the table.

> **Notes:**  
> • For extra depth, simmer shrimp shells in water 20 min to make quick stock.  
> • Texture should be velvety and rich, not stiff; thin with stock as needed.
