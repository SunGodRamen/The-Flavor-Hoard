## Ingredients
- 36 chicken wing segments (drums and flats)
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp baking powder (optional, for extra crispness)
- 4 tsp vegetable oil
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (or half flour, half cornstarch for lighter crust)
- 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, preferably clarified
- 4 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper, to taste
- 1/8 tsp garlic powder
- 4–8 tbsp hot sauce (Frank’s RedHot preferred)
- 1 tsp honey (optional, balances sharp heat)
- Celery sticks, for serving
- Blue cheese dressing, for serving

## Instructions
1. **Prep the wings:** Pat wings very dry with paper towels. For best results, toss with salt (and baking powder if using) and let rest uncovered in the fridge 1–2 hours (or overnight) to dry the skin.
2. Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). Line baking sheets with foil and place a wire rack on top (for airflow).
3. Toss wings with oil, then coat evenly in flour (or flour/cornstarch mix). Shake off excess.
4. Arrange wings on rack in a single layer. Bake 20 minutes, flip, then bake another 20–25 minutes until golden brown and crisp.
5. **Make the sauce:** In a saucepan, combine clarified butter, vinegar, cayenne, garlic powder, hot sauce, and honey if using. Bring to a gentle simmer, whisking until emulsified. Remove from heat.
6. Transfer wings to a large bowl. Pour sauce over and toss until thoroughly coated.
7. Serve hot with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing on the side.

## Notes
- Clarified butter resists separating when mixed with hot sauce, giving a smoother coating.  
- Cornstarch lightens the crust and increases crispiness.  
- Dry-brining the wings in salt and baking powder improves browning and texture.
