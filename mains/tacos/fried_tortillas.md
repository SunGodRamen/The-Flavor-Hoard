## Ingredients
- Corn tortillas (as many as needed)
- Neutral oil for frying (vegetable, canola, or peanut)
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions
1. **Heat Oil:** In a heavy skillet or pot, pour 1–2 cm of oil. Heat to 175–180°C (350–360°F).
2. **For Crispy Taco Shells:**  
   - Using tongs, dip half of a tortilla in oil for 5–10 seconds, then fold gently into a “U” shape.  
   - Hold with tongs until set, then lay on its side to crisp, flipping once.  
   - Drain on paper towels, season lightly with salt.
3. **For Tostadas (Flat):**  
   - Slide tortilla fully into oil and fry until golden and crisp, about 45–60 seconds per side.  
   - Drain and salt immediately.
4. **For Tacos Dorados (Rolled):**  
   - Fill softened tortillas with desired filling (chicken, potato, beef).  
   - Roll tightly and secure with a toothpick if needed.  
   - Fry seam-side down until golden brown, turning to crisp evenly.  
   - Drain and salt.

## Notes
- Warm tortillas briefly before frying to prevent cracks.  
- Work in small batches to maintain oil temperature.  
- Use fried tortillas the same day for best crunch.
