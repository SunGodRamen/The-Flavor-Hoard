## Ingredients
- 90–120 g unsalted butter (6–8 tbsp)
- 12–16 fresh sage leaves
- Pinch of fine salt
- Freshly ground black pepper (or white pepper)

### Optional finishes (choose 1–2)
- 1–2 tsp lemon juice **or** 1 tsp white wine vinegar
- 20–30 g Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated (to serve)
- 1 small garlic clove, lightly crushed (remove before serving)
- 1 tbsp toasted walnuts or pine nuts, chopped
- 1 tsp capers, rinsed and patted dry
- Lemon zest, to taste

## Instructions
1. **Butter + sage:** In a light-colored skillet, melt butter over **medium** heat. Add sage leaves (and garlic, if using).
2. **Brown:** Swirl and stir as butter foams; milk solids will turn **golden-brown** and smell nutty, and sage will crisp (about 3–5 min). Remove garlic if used.
3. **Stop the browning:** Take pan **off heat**. To keep the sauce fluid and emulsified for pasta, splash in **1–2 tbsp hot pasta water** (it will sizzle) and swirl.
4. **Brighten:** Stir in lemon juice or vinegar if using. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
5. **Toss with pasta/gnocchi:** Add drained pasta/gnocchi to the pan with another splash of pasta water. Toss over low heat until glossy and lightly thickened, 30–60 sec.
6. **Serve:** Plate with crisp sage on top. Finish with Parmigiano and optional nuts/capers/zest.

## Notes
- Use **unsalted** butter so you control salinity; a light pan helps you see the browning progress.  
- If the solids go from brown to **black** and smell acrid, the butter is burnt—start over.  
- Sauce look greasy? Whisk in a **cold** knob of butter off heat or add another spoon of pasta water to re-emulsify.  
- For fish/veg (no pasta water handy), stop browning by tipping the pan slightly off heat and adding a teaspoon of water or lemon juice before spooning over.
