## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely diced **or** 1/2 onion halved (to remove later)
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced (optional)
- 2 x 400 g cans whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano preferred), hand-crushed
- 6–8 basil leaves (or 1 sprig)
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance)
- 8–10 g (1 1/2 tsp) fine salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Optional finish: 1 tbsp butter for gloss

## Instructions
1. **Sauté aromatics:** Warm oil over medium. Add onion (and garlic if using). Cook until soft and sweet, 6–8 min, without browning.
2. **Add tomatoes:** Stir in crushed tomatoes and any juices. Add basil and a pinch of salt.
3. **Simmer:** Cook at a gentle bubble **25–35 min**, stirring occasionally, until slightly thick and bright. Add sugar only if needed.
4. **Season & finish:** Remove basil and (if used) onion half. Season with salt/pepper. Stir in butter if desired.
5. **Use/Store:** Toss with hot pasta (add a splash of pasta water). Keeps 5 days chilled or 3 months frozen.

## Notes
- Smoother texture: pass through a food mill or blend briefly.  
- For arrabbiata: bloom 1/2–1 tsp chili flakes with the oil at the start.
