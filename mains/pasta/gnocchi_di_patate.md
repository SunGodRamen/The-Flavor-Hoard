## Equipment
- Oven + baking sheet/rack (bake potatoes)
- Potato ricer or food mill
- Bench scraper
- Large pot (boil)
- Slotted spoon/skimmer
- Gnocchi board or fork (optional)

## Ingredients
- 1 kg starchy potatoes (Russet or similar), scrubbed
- 250 g all-purpose flour (about **25%** of potato weight), plus extra for dusting
- 1 large egg (50 g), lightly beaten
- 8 g (1 1/2 tsp) kosher salt

## Instructions
1. **Cook & dry:** Bake potatoes **whole** on salt or a rack at 200°C/400°F until tender (60–75 min). While hot, split to steam off moisture 5 min.
2. **Rice:** Peel and rice while warm onto a clean work surface. Sprinkle salt over.
3. **Add egg & flour:** Drizzle egg over potatoes. Add 200 g flour to start. Gently fold with a bench scraper, adding just enough extra flour to form a **soft, barely tacky** dough. Do **not** knead heavily.
4. **Roll & cut:** Divide into 4. Roll ropes ~2 cm thick; cut 2–3 cm pillows. Dust lightly. Optional: roll on a gnocchi board/fork.
5. **Cook:** Boil in well-salted water. When gnocchi float, cook **30–60 sec** more. Transfer straight into sauce with some cooking water.
6. **Sauce & serve:** Toss gently with **Sugo al Pomodoro** or brown butter & sage; finish with Parmigiano.

## Notes
- If dough feels sticky, dust with flour sparingly; too much flour = heavy gnocchi.  
- Potatoes can be microwaved or steamed, but baking dries them best.  
- Freeze on a tray; cook from frozen (add ~1 min).
