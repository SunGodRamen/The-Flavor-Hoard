## Ingredients
- 1 whole packer brisket, 5–7 kg (trimmed to ~6–9 mm / 1/4–3/8" fat cap)
- 50 g Brisket Rub (see `mains/bbq/sauces/brisket_rub_spg.md`)
- Optional mustard/worcestershire slather

## Instructions
1. **Trim + Season:** Square edges, thin fat cap to 6–9 mm. Light slather; coat evenly with SPG rub. Rest 30–60 min.
2. **Smoke:** 110–120°C / 225–250°F, clean blue smoke (oak). Fat cap up or down per pit—shield from heat source.
3. **Build bark:** Smoke to **70–76°C / 160–170°F** internal (4–6 h). Spritz lightly after 2 h if dry.
4. **Wrap:** Butcher paper (preferred) or foil. Return to pit to **93–96°C / 200–205°F**, but go by **probe tenderness**.
5. **Rest:** Hold wrapped in a cooler 1–2 h. Slice flat across the grain, rotate for point. Serve with Texas Mop on side.

## Notes
- If bark threatens to burn, lower pit to 105°C / 220°F and skip spritzing.
