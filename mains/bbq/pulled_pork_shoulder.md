## Ingredients
- 3–4 kg bone-in pork shoulder
- 60–80 g Pork Rub (see `mains/bbq/rubs/pork_rub_sweet_heat.md`)
- 1/2–1 tsp mustard powder (mixed into rub if not already included)
- Apple juice + cider vinegar (50/50) in spritz bottle
- Optional: 120 ml apple juice for wrap

## Instructions
1. **Season:** Coat shoulder evenly with pork rub (including mustard powder). Press firmly so it adheres. Rest 30–60 min.
2. **Smoke:** 110–120°C / 225–250°F with apple/cherry wood to **70–75°C / 160–168°F** internal.
3. **Wrap:** Butcher paper or foil with a splash of apple juice. Continue to **93–96°C / 200–205°F** until **probe tender**.
4. **Rest & Pull:** Rest 45–90 min. Pull with gloved hands or forks; moisten with rendered juices.
5. **Sauce:** Toss portions lightly with **Carolina Mustard Sauce** or serve sauces on the side.

## Tip
- For “money muscle” slices, harvest the tubular muscle at ~90–93°C before pulling the rest.
