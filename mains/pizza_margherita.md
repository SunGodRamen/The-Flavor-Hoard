## Ingredients
### Dough (24–48 h cold ferment)
- 500 g 00 flour (or strong bread flour)
- 325 g water (65% hydration), cool
- 10 g fine sea salt
- 2 g instant yeast (or 3 g active dry)

### Topping (per pizza)
- 130–160 g crushed high-quality tomatoes (San Marzano or similar), lightly salted
- 120–140 g fresh mozzarella, well-drained & torn
- 6–8 basil leaves
- Extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions
1. **Mix:** Stir flour, yeast, water until shaggy. Rest 20 min (autolyse). Add salt; mix until smooth (3–4 min by hand).
2. **Bulk:** 30 min at room temp; perform 2–3 stretch-and-folds every 20 min if dough is slack.
3. **Cold ferment:** Divide into 2 balls (≈415 g each). Lightly oil, cover, and refrigerate **24–48 h**.
4. **Preheat:** Place steel/stone on top rack. Heat oven to **260°C/500°F** (or max) for **45–60 min**.
5. **Warm dough:** Bring dough to room temp 60–90 min before baking.
6. **Shape:** Flour the bench. Press dough into a 12–13 in round, leaving a 2–3 cm rim. Avoid degassing the edge.
7. **Top:** Spread a thin layer of tomatoes; add mozzarella sparsely, a few basil leaves, and a drizzle of oil.
8. **Bake:** Launch onto steel/stone. Bake **6–8 min** until crust is browned and cheese just colored. For extra top color, switch to **broil** for the final 30–60 sec (watch closely).
9. **Finish:** Add fresh basil and a final drizzle of oil. Slice immediately.

## Notes
- Sauce: tomatoes + pinch of salt; skip sugar/herbs for classic brightness.  
- If using a sheet pan: preheat inverted pan; bake 8–10 min.  
- High hydration helps oven spring; adjust water ±10 g depending on flour strength.
