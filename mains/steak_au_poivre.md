## Ingredients
- 2 strip steaks or filets (280–320 g each, 3–4 cm thick)
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tbsp whole black peppercorns, coarsely cracked
- 1 tbsp brined green peppercorns, rinsed & lightly crushed (optional but classic)
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 30 g butter
- 60 ml cognac (or brandy)
- 120 ml beef stock
- 90 ml heavy cream
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)

## Instructions
1. **Season & crust:** Pat steaks dry. Season all sides with salt. Press cracked black pepper (and green peppercorns, if using) into the surfaces.
2. **Sear:** Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add steaks; sear **3–4 min per side** to deep brown. Add butter in final minute and baste.  
   - Pull at **50°C/122°F (rare)**, **55°C/131°F (m-rare)**, **60°C/140°F (medium)**.
3. **Rest:** Transfer steaks to a warm plate; tent loosely.
4. **Sauce:** Carefully pour off excess fat, leaving peppery fond. Off heat, add cognac; return to medium heat and **flambé** or reduce, scraping up fond. Add stock; reduce by half. Stir in cream (and Dijon if using); simmer to nappe. Season with a pinch of salt.
5. **Finish:** Return steaks and resting juices to the pan to glaze **15–20 sec**. Serve with plenty of sauce.
