## Ingredients
### Cutlets
- 4 chicken breasts, butterflied & pounded to 1 cm (3/8 in)
- 8 g (1 1/2 tsp) kosher salt
- Black pepper

### Breading
- 60 g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten with 1 tbsp water
- 120 g (1 1/2 cups) fine breadcrumbs (or 50/50 panko + italian crumbs)
- 40 g (1/2 cup) finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried oregano

### To Cook & Finish
- Neutral oil, for shallow-frying
- 600–700 ml **Sugo al Pomodoro** (see `sauces/sugo_al_pomodoro.md`)
- 250 g low-moisture mozzarella, sliced or shredded
- 30 g (1/3 cup) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Fresh basil leaves

## Instructions
1. **Season cutlets:** Salt & pepper both sides. Rest 10–15 min.
2. **Bread:** Set up 3 dishes: flour; eggs; crumbs mixed with parmesan, garlic powder, oregano. Dredge flour → egg → crumbs (press gently). Chill 10 min to set.
3. **Fry:** Heat 0.5 cm oil in a wide skillet to 175°C/350°F. Fry cutlets 2–3 min/side until deeply golden. Drain on rack.
4. **Assemble:** Heat oven to 220°C/425°F. Spoon thin layer of sugo in a baking dish. Add cutlets, top each with sugo, mozzarella, and a sprinkle of parmesan.
5. **Bake:** 10–12 min until cheese is melted and bubbling; broil 1–2 min for browned spots.
6. **Finish:** Rest 3–5 min. Scatter basil. Serve with spaghetti dressed in more sugo.

## Notes
- Extra-crisp: double-dip egg + crumbs.  
- Air-fryer: 200°C/390°F ~8–10 min, flip once; top with sauce/cheese and cook 2–3 min more.
