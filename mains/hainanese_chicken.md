## Instructions
1. **Prep chicken:** Trim excess fat (reserve for rice). Rub chicken skin with salt to exfoliate; rinse and pat dry. Stuff cavity with ginger & scallion.
2. **Poach:** Bring water with white pepper to a **bare simmer (80–85°C / 175–185°F)**. Submerge chicken; when the pot returns to a gentle tremble, lower heat, cover, and cook **35–45 min** (to **68–70°C / 155–158°F** at the breast).  
3. **Tighten skin:** Lift chicken; plunge into ice water **5–10 min**. Pat dry; brush lightly with sesame oil. Keep warm.
4. **Rice:** Render reserved chicken fat in a pot; add oil if needed. Sauté garlic & ginger **1–2 min** fragrant. Add drained rice; stir to coat glossy **1 min**. Add pandan, hot broth, salt. Bring to a boil; cover and cook **12 min** on low. Rest **10 min**, covered. Fluff.
5. **Ginger–Scallion Oil:** Combine ginger & scallion in a heatproof bowl with salt. Pour smoking-hot oil over; stir. Adjust with a splash of vinegar if desired.
6. **Chili Sauce:** Blend chilies, garlic, lime, vinegar, sugar, salt, fish sauce, and enough hot broth to a pourable consistency.
7. **Serve:** Chop chicken bone-in or slice boneless. Plate over rice with cucumber & tomato. Ladle a small bowl of hot broth. Offer ginger–scallion oil, chili sauce, and light soy at the table.

**Notes**
- For ultra-silky meat, hold the chicken in 75–78°C / 167–172°F liquid for **50–60 min**.  
- Save remaining broth for soups or for cooking more rice.
