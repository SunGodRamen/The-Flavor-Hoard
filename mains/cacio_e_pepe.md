## Ingredients
- 200 g spaghetti or tonnarelli
- 100 g very finely grated Pecorino Romano (microplane or powdery)
- 2–3 tsp freshly cracked black pepper (16–20 mesh)
- 20 g (1 1/2 tbsp) butter **or** 2 tbsp olive oil (traditionalists omit; include for insurance)
- Salt (for pasta water)

## Instructions
1. **Toast pepper:** In a wide pan, warm pepper over medium until fragrant (30–60 sec). Add butter/oil if using; swirl. Kill heat.
2. **Cook pasta:** Boil in **lightly** salted water (pasta water should be less salty than usual). Reserve **300 ml** starchy water.
3. **Make emulsion:** Add 120 ml pasta water to the pepper pan; simmer to reduce slightly.
4. **Cheese paste:** In a bowl, whisk pecorino with 2–3 tbsp warm pasta water into a thick, smooth paste (no lumps).
5. **Marry:** Move al dente pasta to the pan. Toss over medium-low, adding splashes of water to form a glossy emulsion.
6. **Cheese on, off heat:** Remove pan from heat. Add cheese paste and toss quickly, loosening with more water until creamy and clinging.
7. **Serve:** Plate immediately. Top with a pinch more pepper.

## Notes
- Temperature control prevents clumping: cheese goes in **off heat**.  
- Use very fine cheese and very starchy water (finish pasta in the pan) for best emulsification.
