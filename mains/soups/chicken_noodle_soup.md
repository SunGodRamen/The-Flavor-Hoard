## Ingredients
- 2 L chicken broth (see Chicken Broth recipe)
- 400 g cooked chicken, shredded (from broth or roasted)
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200 g egg noodles
- 2 tbsp olive oil or butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped (optional)
- Juice of 1/2 lemon (optional, for brightness)

## Instructions
1. In a large pot, heat olive oil or butter. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook 5–7 minutes until softened.
2. Stir in garlic; cook 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in chicken broth. Bring to a gentle simmer.
4. Add shredded chicken and noodles. Cook until noodles are tender (6–8 minutes).
5. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice if using.
6. Finish with parsley and dill. Serve hot.

## Notes
- Noodles will absorb broth as they sit; for make-ahead, cook noodles separately and add when serving.  
- Add extra broth if you prefer a soupier consistency.
