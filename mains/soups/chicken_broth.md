## Ingredients
- 1.5 kg bone-in chicken pieces (legs, thighs, or whole cut-up chicken)
- 3 L cold water
- 2 medium onions, halved
- 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp whole black peppercorns
- 1 tsp kosher salt (adjust to taste)
- Optional: parsley stems, thyme sprigs

## Instructions
1. Place chicken, vegetables, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt in a large pot. Cover with cold water.
2. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a gentle simmer. Skim foam as it rises.
3. Simmer 60â€“90 minutes until chicken is cooked through and broth is flavorful.
4. Remove chicken; set aside for shredding or other recipes.
5. Strain broth through a fine sieve. Discard vegetables and spices.
6. Use immediately, or cool and refrigerate up to 4 days, or freeze up to 3 months.

## Notes
- For richer flavor, roast chicken and vegetables before simmering.  
- Skim fat from cooled broth for a lighter result, or leave it for more body.
